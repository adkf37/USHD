# HALE - Race Ethnicity - 2025

This repo contains cleaned code used to generate life expectancy estimates in 'Healthy life expectancy by county, race, and ethnicity in the USA, 2009–19: a systematic analysis of health disparities' published in The Lancet Regional Health – Americas on April 17, 2025. 

This repo contains five directories:

1) covariates contains code to generate various covariates used in the modeling process.
2) non_fatal contains code to model HALE using prepared survey data.
3) population contains code to generate population by county, year, age, sex, and race and ethnicity / marital status / educational attainment.
4) risk_factors contains code to prepare data used in non_fatal modeling.
5) sae.shared contains code to generate life expectancy, as well as shared tools, scripts, and related utilities for modeling.
